# aes-T
a chip trojan base on AES
Whenever predefined input plaintext is observed, the Trojan exfiltrates the key from the running cryptographic chip

AES algorithm. The channel adapts to the concept of spread spectrum communication to distribute the leakage of a single bit over multiple clock cycles.

Trojans create CDMA code sequences by using pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs),

The PRNG is initialized to enter plaintext. The code sequence is then used to XOR modulate the secret information bits.

The modulation sequence is forwarded to a leakage circuit (LC) to establish a covert CDMA channel in the power-side channel.
